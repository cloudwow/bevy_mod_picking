A [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) plugin for 3D mouse picking and raycasting, making it easy to interact with 3D geometry using your mouse or any other raycasting source! The plugin provides a number of raycasting sources, built-in mouse events, highlighting, selection state, multi-window support, and a 3D debug cursor.

**Expect breaking changes in `master` branch - contributions are welcome!**

## Features
* [Pick Data](#getting-pick-data): intersection surface normal and coordinates in world space
* [Mesh Interaction](#interacting-with-meshes): mouseover and mouseclick, highlighting, selection state
* [Debug cursor](#debug): debug pick intersections and surface normals with a 3d cursor

## Demo

To run the `3d_scene` example - a modified version of the `Bevy` example of the same name - clone this repository and run:

```console
cargo run --example 3d_scene --features="ex"
```

Note that by default this plugin only depends on bevy's `render` feature to minimize both dependency count and compile time, as well as allow for wasm support. This is why the feature flag is needed to run examples, which need the winit and wgpu features to run.

# Getting Started

It only takes a few lines to get mouse picking working in your Bevy application using this plugin. The following sections will walk you through what is needed to get the plugin working, and how everything fits together.

## Setup

Add the plugin to your dependencies in Cargo.toml

```toml
bevy_mod_picking = "0.3"
```

Import the plugin:

```rust
use bevy_mod_picking::*;
```

Add it to your App::build() in the plugins section of your Bevy app:

```rust
.add_plugin(PickingPlugin)
```

## Marking Entities for Picking

For simple use cases, you will probably be using the mouse to pick items in a 3d scene. You can mark your camera with a default PickSource component:

```rust
.with(PickSource::default())
```

Now all you have to do is mark any mesh entities with the `PickableMesh` component:

```rust
.with(PickableMesh::default())
```

And that's all you need to get started! To learn how to retreive picking intersections, you can jump to the [Getting Pick Data](#getting-pick-data) section. If you also need interaction features, e.g. mouseclick & mousehover events, highlighting, and selection state, continue reading.

# Interacting with Meshes

To get mouseover and mouseclick events, as well as built-in highlighting and selection state, you will need to add the `InteractablePickingPlugin` plugin. This is intentionally left optional, in case you only need pick intersection results.

```rust
// Add this below the PickingPlugin line
.add_plugin(InteractablePickingPlugin)
```

See the [Pick Interactions](#pick-interactions) section for more details on the features this provides.
You will need to add the `InteractableMesh` component to entities to use these features.

```rust
.with(PickableMesh::default())
.with(InteractableMesh::default())
```

If you want a mesh to highlight when you hover, add the `HighlightablePickMesh` component:

```rust
// InteractableMesh component is a prerequisite for this to work
.with(HighlightablePickMesh::default())
```

If you also want to select meshes and keep them highlighted when clicked with the left mouse button, add the `SelectablePickMesh` component:

```rust
// InteractableMesh component is a prerequisite for this to work
.with(SelectablePickMesh::default())
```

# Pick Groups

Pick groups allow you to associate meshes with a raycasting source, and produce a pick result for each group. For simple use cases, such as a single 3d view and camera, you can ignore this.

For those simple cases, you can just use `Group::default()` any time a `Group` is required. This will assign the `PickableMesh` or `PickSource` to picking group 0.

Pick groups are useful in cases such as multiple windows, where you want each window to have its own picking source (cursor relative to that window's camera), and each window might have a different set of meshes that this picking source can intersect. The primary window might assign the camera and all relavent meshes to pick group 0, while the secondary window uses pick group 1 for these. See the [multiple_windows](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/blob/master/examples/multiple_windows.rs) example for implementation details.

## Constraints

- Only one PickSource can be assigned to a `Group`
- A PickableMesh can be assigned to one or more `Group`s
- The result of running the picking system is an ordered list of all intersections of each `PickSource` with the `PickableMesh`s in that `Group`. The ordered list of intersections are stored by `Group`, `HashMap<Group, Vec<PickIntersection>>`

# Getting Pick Data

Mesh picking intersections are reported in world coordinates. A ray is cast into the scene using the `PickSource` you provided, and checked for intersections against every mesh that has been marked as a `PickableMesh`. The results report which entities were intersected, as well as the 3D coordinates of the corresponding intersection. The results are reported in pick groups, allowing the same mesh(es) to be pickable by different sets of `PickSource`s.

You can use the `PickState` resource to either get the topmost entity, or a list of all entities sorted by distance (near -> far) under the cursor:

```rust
fn get_picks(
    pick_state: Res<PickState>,
) {
    println!("All entities:\n{:?}", pick_state.list(Group::default()));
    println!("Top entity:\n{:?}", pick_state.top(Group::default()));
}
```

Alternatively, and perhaps more idiomatic to the Bevy ECS system, you can get the intersections for entities that have the `PickableMesh` component using:

```rust
pickable_entity.intersection(Group::default());
```

This might be useful if you are already iterating over all mesh entities, in which case you can simply add the `PickableMesh` component to your query.

## Pick Interactions

Run the `events` example to see mouseover and mouseclick events in action:

```console
cargo run --example events
```

The `InteractableMesh` component stores mouseover event state, mouseclick event state (left, right, and middle buttons), and hover state.

## Selection State

If you're using the `SelectablePickMesh` component for selection, you can access the selection state by querying your selectable entities and accessing the `.selected()` function.

## Plugin Parameters

If you're using the built in `HighlightablePickMash` component for highlighting, you can change the colors by accessing the `PickHighlightParams` and setting the colors:

```rust
// Example Bevy system to set the highlight colors
fn set_highlight_params(
    mut highlight_params: ResMut<PickHighlightParams>,
) {
    highlight_params.set_hover_color(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));
    highlight_params.set_selection_color(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
}
```

# Debug

You can enable a debug cursor that will place a sphere at the intersection, with a tail pointing normal to the surface. Just add the `DebugPickingPlugin` to the `App::build()` in your Bevy program:

```rust
.add_plugin(DebugPickingPlugin)
```

# Bounding Sphere Optimization

This plugin has the ability to accelerate picking with bounding spheres; this can make picking as much as **30 times faster**! This speeds up the picking process by first checking to see if the picking source intersects a mesh's bounding sphere before going through every triangle in the mesh. To enable bounding spheres, you can use the builder pattern to pass a handle to your mesh into the `.with_bounding_sphere()` function:

```rust
.with(PickableMesh::default()
    .with_bounding_sphere(mesh_handle)
);
```

This will run a system in Bevy to automatically compute the bounding sphere of the supplied mesh.You can see an example of bounding spheres used in the `stress_test` example. Please be aware that the API for this feature is likely to change over coming releases.
